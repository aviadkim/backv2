Performance
"Performance is the percentage trend in asset value and therefore expresses the return on a securities portfolio over a given period of time. The performance indicator is expressed as “Total Return”. In
fact, the calculation takes not only price gains/losses into account but also interest (including pro rata interest) and dividend payments.
The Bank calculates performance using the TWR (Time-Weighted Return) calculation method, which measures the compound rate of return on a portfolio, eliminating the impact of any cash flows made
by the investor (deposits or withdrawals).
Performance is stated net, i.e. performance net of taxes and of transaction and management fees.
The asset valuation reports the information available at the time of preparation of the asset valuation for the relevant valuation date."
