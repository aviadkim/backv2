Product Risk Classifier (PRC)
"The PRC (Product Risk Classifier) is a risk indicator, provided by third parties, which is based on quantitative models. This provides an indication of the financial risk of the individual investment products
and therefore allows comparing the financial risk of financial instruments belonging to various asset categories and classes.
This value is calculated by taking into consideration the three basis aspects of an investment productâ€™s financial risk: the market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Portfolio Risk Classifer (PRC) is measured on a scale that goes from 1 (very low risk) to 5 (very high risk)."
