Valuations and prices
"The present valuation is for information purposes only. The valuation of the assets in this statement is based on the prices and exchange rates derived from commonly used information sources in the
banking sector that the Bank considers to be reliable.
The stated prices and exchange rates are merely indicative and by no means binding on the Bank; they do not necessarily reflect the amounts actually attainable through market trading. Positions
marked ""price to be verified"" refer to instruments that are illiquid or for which no price and/or updated price can be obtained from an official source.
The data set forth in the asset valuation - even if they refer to the same valuation date but are generated at different times - may differ from one another due to transactions and/or adjustments,
particularly value adjustments, that have been recorded in the meantime with a retroactive effect or value date.
The Bank in no way guarantees the accuracy or completeness of the present valuation, the information contained herewith or the calculations related to the assets held in custody.
The Bank disclaims all liability for any loss or damage connected with use of the valuation and related information.
This document is neither designed nor suitable for tax purposes.
Any discrepancies or objections shall be reported to the Bank in writing within 30 days. Otherwise, the contents of this document will be deemed accepted."
