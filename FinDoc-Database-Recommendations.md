# FinDoc SaaS Database Recommendations

## Overview

This document provides recommendations for database solutions to handle document storage and processing in the FinDoc SaaS application. The recommendations consider scalability, security, performance, and cost-effectiveness for a multi-tenant SaaS application dealing with financial documents.

## Requirements

The FinDoc application has the following database requirements:

1. **Multi-tenancy**: Each client's data must be securely isolated
2. **Document storage**: Efficient storage and retrieval of PDF and Excel files
3. **Structured data**: Storage of extracted financial data, ISINs, and metadata
4. **Search capabilities**: Fast search across documents and extracted data
5. **Analytics**: Support for financial analytics and reporting
6. **Compliance**: Meet financial industry security and compliance requirements
7. **Scalability**: Handle growing number of clients and documents
8. **Performance**: Fast queries and data processing

## Recommended Database Architecture

We recommend a **hybrid database approach** with three main components:

1. **Relational Database**: For structured data, user management, and relationships
2. **Document Storage**: For storing and retrieving the actual document files
3. **Search Index**: For fast full-text search across documents and metadata

### Option 1: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)

**Recommendation: Supabase is our top recommendation for most use cases.**

#### Pros:
- **All-in-one solution**: PostgreSQL database, storage, authentication, and APIs
- **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: Built-in multi-tenancy through PostgreSQL RLS policies
- **PostgreSQL**: Powerful relational database with JSON support
- **Storage**: Built-in storage solution for document files
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Live updates for collaborative features
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth with multiple providers
- **Serverless**: No infrastructure management required
- **Free tier**: Generous free tier for development and small deployments
- **Open source**: Core components are open source

#### Cons:
- **Newer platform**: Less mature than some alternatives
- **Limited regions**: Fewer deployment regions than AWS or Azure
- **Search limitations**: Full-text search capabilities are more limited than dedicated search solutions

#### Implementation:
1. **User/Tenant Management**: Use Supabase Auth for user management
2. **Document Storage**: Use Supabase Storage for document files
3. **Structured Data**: Use PostgreSQL tables with RLS policies for tenant isolation
4. **Search**: Use PostgreSQL full-text search capabilities
5. **Analytics**: Use PostgreSQL for analytics or export to a dedicated analytics tool

#### Cost Estimate:
- **Free Tier**: 500MB database, 1GB storage, 50MB/day egress
- **Pro Plan**: $25/month for 8GB database, 100GB storage
- **Pay As You Go**: Custom pricing based on usage

### Option 2: AWS (RDS + S3 + OpenSearch)

**Recommendation: Best for enterprise clients with complex requirements.**

#### Pros:
- **Mature ecosystem**: Well-established services with proven reliability
- **Scalability**: Virtually unlimited scaling capabilities
- **Compliance**: Extensive compliance certifications (HIPAA, SOC, etc.)
- **Global presence**: Multiple regions worldwide
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with other AWS services
- **Advanced security**: Comprehensive security features

#### Cons:
- **Complexity**: More complex to set up and maintain
- **Cost management**: Can be expensive if not carefully managed
- **Learning curve**: Steeper learning curve than all-in-one solutions

#### Implementation:
1. **User/Tenant Management**: AWS Cognito for authentication and user management
2. **Document Storage**: S3 for document storage with bucket policies for isolation
3. **Structured Data**: RDS PostgreSQL or Aurora with schema-based tenant isolation
4. **Search**: OpenSearch Service for full-text search and analytics
5. **Analytics**: Redshift or Athena for advanced analytics

#### Cost Estimate:
- **RDS (t3.small)**: ~$30-40/month
- **S3**: ~$0.023/GB/month + request costs
- **OpenSearch**: ~$100/month for a small domain
- **Total**: $150-200/month for a small deployment

### Option 3: MongoDB Atlas + MinIO

**Recommendation: Good for document-heavy workloads with less structured data.**

#### Pros:
- **Document-oriented**: Native support for document data models
- **Flexible schema**: Adapt to changing data requirements
- **Atlas**: Fully managed service with global deployment
- **Search**: Built-in full-text search capabilities
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling for growing workloads
- **MinIO**: Open-source S3-compatible object storage

#### Cons:
- **Less relational**: Not as strong for complex relational data
- **Transaction support**: More limited than PostgreSQL
- **Cost**: Can be expensive at scale

#### Implementation:
1. **User/Tenant Management**: MongoDB collections with tenant field and indexes
2. **Document Storage**: MinIO for document storage
3. **Structured Data**: MongoDB collections with appropriate indexes
4. **Search**: MongoDB Atlas Search
5. **Analytics**: MongoDB Aggregation Framework or export to analytics tools

#### Cost Estimate:
- **MongoDB Atlas (M10)**: ~$60/month
- **MinIO**: Self-hosted or cloud provider storage costs
- **Total**: $80-120/month for a small deployment

## Multi-Tenancy Implementation

For a SaaS application, proper multi-tenancy is critical. We recommend:

### 1. Supabase Approach (Recommended)

Use PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:

```sql
-- Example RLS policy for documents table
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON documents
    USING (tenant_id = auth.uid());
```

This ensures each tenant can only access their own data, even if they share the same database tables.

### 2. AWS Approach

Use a combination of:
- **Schema-based isolation**: Separate PostgreSQL schemas for each tenant
- **S3 bucket policies**: Restrict access to tenant-specific prefixes
- **IAM roles**: Fine-grained access control

### 3. MongoDB Approach

Use a combination of:
- **Field-based isolation**: Include tenant_id in all documents
- **Compound indexes**: Include tenant_id in all indexes
- **Application-level enforcement**: Filter by tenant_id in all queries

## Document Processing Pipeline

Regardless of the database choice, we recommend the following document processing pipeline:

1. **Upload**: Client uploads document to application
2. **Storage**: Document is stored in object storage (Supabase Storage, S3, or MinIO)
3. **Processing**: Background worker processes document:
   - Extract text and metadata
   - Parse financial data
   - Extract ISINs and other identifiers
4. **Indexing**: Store structured data in database and update search index
5. **Notification**: Notify user when processing is complete

## Scaling Considerations

As the application grows, consider:

1. **Read replicas**: For high-read workloads
2. **Sharding**: For very large datasets
3. **Caching**: Redis or similar for frequently accessed data
4. **CDN**: For document delivery to global users
5. **Dedicated search**: Elasticsearch or similar for advanced search at scale

## Security Recommendations

For financial data, security is paramount:

1. **Encryption**: Encrypt data at rest and in transit
2. **Access control**: Implement least privilege access
3. **Audit logging**: Track all data access and changes
4. **Backup strategy**: Regular backups with point-in-time recovery
5. **Compliance checks**: Regular security audits and compliance reviews

## Migration Path

Start with Supabase for most use cases, as it provides:
1. Fastest time to market
2. Lowest initial complexity
3. Good balance of features and cost
4. Room to grow

If specific requirements emerge that Supabase cannot handle, the architecture allows for:
1. Adding specialized services (e.g., dedicated search)
2. Migrating specific components to other providers
3. Hybrid approaches combining multiple solutions

## Conclusion

For the FinDoc SaaS application, we recommend:

1. **Start with Supabase** for most use cases
2. **Consider AWS** for enterprise deployments with specific compliance requirements
3. **Consider MongoDB Atlas** for document-heavy workloads with less structured data

The hybrid database architecture provides flexibility to adapt as requirements evolve, while the multi-tenancy approach ensures secure isolation of client data from day one.
