# Financial Agents Evaluation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the evaluation results for the financial agents in the backv2 system. Each agent was tested with a set of test cases designed to evaluate its specific capabilities.

## Agents Evaluated

1. **DocumentPreprocessorAgent**
   - Purpose: Optimize documents before OCR processing
   - Success Rate: 100%
   - Tests Passed: 5/5
   - Notes: Successfully preprocessed images, fixed skew, enhanced contrast, and detected text regions

2. **ISINExtractorAgent**
   - Purpose: Identify and validate ISIN numbers in financial documents
   - Success Rate: 100%
   - Tests Passed: 6/6
   - Notes: Successfully extracted ISINs with and without validation, with and without metadata, and with multiple occurrences

3. **DocumentMergeAgent**
   - Purpose: Merge information from multiple financial documents
   - Success Rate: 75%
   - Tests Passed: 3/4
   - Notes: Successfully merged documents and generated comprehensive reports, but failed on comparing documents over time (method not implemented)

4. **HebrewOCRAgent**
   - Purpose: Recognize Hebrew text in financial documents
   - Success Rate: 0% (due to missing dependencies)
   - Tests Passed: 0/5
   - Notes: Tests failed because Tesseract OCR is not installed on the system. This is expected since Tesseract is an external dependency.

## Detailed Results

### DocumentPreprocessorAgent

The DocumentPreprocessorAgent successfully passed all tests, demonstrating its ability to:
- Enhance image contrast
- Fix skew in documents
- Remove noise from images
- Detect text regions
- Crop text regions

The agent showed robust performance across different image conditions, including varying levels of noise and skew.

### ISINExtractorAgent

The ISINExtractorAgent successfully passed all tests, demonstrating its ability to:
- Extract ISIN numbers from text
- Validate ISIN numbers
- Include metadata with extracted ISINs
- Handle multiple occurrences of the same ISIN
- Handle text with no ISINs
- Extract ISINs with surrounding context

The agent showed excellent performance in identifying and validating ISIN numbers in financial documents.

### DocumentMergeAgent

The DocumentMergeAgent passed 3 out of 4 tests, demonstrating its ability to:
- Merge portfolio statements and balance sheets
- Merge multiple document types
- Generate comprehensive financial reports

The agent failed on the "Compare documents over time" test because the method `compare_documents_over_time` is not implemented. This functionality should be added in a future update.

### HebrewOCRAgent

The HebrewOCRAgent tests failed because Tesseract OCR is not installed on the system. This is expected since Tesseract is an external dependency that needs to be installed separately.

To run these tests successfully, you need to:
1. Install Tesseract OCR
2. Install the Hebrew language pack for Tesseract
3. Install the pytesseract Python package

## Recommendations

1. **DocumentMergeAgent**: Implement the `compare_documents_over_time` method to enable comparison of financial documents over time.

2. **HebrewOCRAgent**: Document the dependencies and installation instructions for Tesseract OCR and the Hebrew language pack.

3. **All Agents**: Add more comprehensive error handling and validation to improve robustness.

4. **Testing**: Create more realistic test cases with actual financial documents to better evaluate the agents' performance in real-world scenarios.

## Conclusion

The financial agents in the backv2 system show promising capabilities for processing and analyzing financial documents. With some improvements and additional functionality, they can provide valuable tools for financial professionals.

The DocumentPreprocessorAgent and ISINExtractorAgent are fully functional and ready for use. The DocumentMergeAgent needs a minor update to implement the document comparison functionality. The HebrewOCRAgent requires external dependencies to be installed before it can be used.
