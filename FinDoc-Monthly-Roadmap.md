## Daily Development Workflow

1. **Morning (9:00 AM - 12:00 PM)**
   - Review previous day's work
   - Address any blocking issues
   - Implement core functionality
   - Commit code regularly

2. **Afternoon (1:00 PM - 4:00 PM)**
   - Continue implementation
   - Write tests for new features
   - Review and refactor code
   - Document new functionality

3. **Late Afternoon (4:00 PM - 6:00 PM)**
   - Test and debug
   - Prepare for next day's tasks
