# UI Status: DevDocs vs. FinDoc Analyzer

## What Happened to the FinDoc Analyzer UI?

You may have noticed that there were two different user interfaces:

1. **DevDocs** - The original document management system
2. **FinDoc Analyzer** - A more advanced financial document analysis dashboard

The FinDoc Analyzer UI you saw previously (with the dashboard showing document counts, ISIN numbers, etc.) is a separate UI theme/project that was being displayed. It appears that when we fixed the backend API connection, the system reverted to showing the original DevDocs interface.

## Options for Restoring FinDoc Analyzer UI

We have several options to restore the FinDoc Analyzer UI:

1. **Switch to FinDoc branch/project**
   - If FinDoc is a separate branch or project, we need to switch to it
   
2. **Implement the FinDoc UI in this project**
   - We can implement the FinDoc design in the current DevDocs project
   
3. **Find the source of the UI switch**
   - There might be a configuration setting causing the UI to change

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Check if there's a separate `findoc` directory or branch in the project
2. Look for any environment variables or settings that might control the UI theme
3. If you'd like to implement the FinDoc UI in the DevDocs project, we can create the necessary components

## Quick Implementation of FinDoc UI

If you'd like to quickly implement aspects of the FinDoc UI in the current DevDocs project, we can:

1. Create a new dashboard page with the FinDoc styling
2. Enhance the document listing to include financial metrics
3. Add ISIN number extraction and display
4. Implement the sidebar navigation seen in FinDoc

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer to take.
