## Implementation Notes

### Agent System Architecture
The agent system will be based on a modular architecture:

1. **Agent Registry**: Central repository of available agents
2. **Agent Configuration**: Interface for setting up agent parameters
3. **Execution Engine**: Runs agents on documents according to schedules
4. **Document Pipeline**: Manages document flow through multiple agents
5. **Result Store**: Captures and indexes agent processing results

### Agent Types to Implement
- Document Analyzer: Extracts metadata and content
- ISIN Extractor: Identifies investment securities
- Portfolio Analyzer: Analyzes investment portfolios
- Regulatory Compliance: Checks for compliance issues
- Summary Generator: Creates document summaries
- Classification Agent: Categorizes documents by type and content

## Technology Stack
- Frontend: Next.js, React
- Backend: Flask, Python
- Document Processing: PyPDF2, Tesseract OCR
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Machine Learning: TensorFlow/PyTorch for advanced analysis
